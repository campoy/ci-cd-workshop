### About

A [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-powered demo [blog](https://ci-cd-workshop.herokuapp.com).


#### A Note on Tooling

This project is designed to use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) or [Circle](https://circleci.com) for automated testing, and [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) for deployment. We use these tools because they're popular, free, and integrate well with GitHub.

That said, there are many other great tools out there offering similar features. We recommend you decide for yourself which tools are most appropriate for your own projects.

Check out the [Integrations Directory](https://github.com/integrations) for an overview of 3rd party tools you can use with GitHub.
